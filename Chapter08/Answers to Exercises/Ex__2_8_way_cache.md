# Chapter 8, Exercise 2

Consider an 8-way set associative L2 cache of 256KB, with 64 bytes in each cache line. How many sets are in this cache?

# Answer
The number of lines in the cache is 262,144 &divide; 64 = 4096.

Each set contains 8 lines.

The number of sets = 4096 lines &divide; 8 lines per set = **512 sets**
