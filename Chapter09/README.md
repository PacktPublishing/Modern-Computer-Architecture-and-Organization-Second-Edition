# Chapter 9 - Specialized Processor Extensions

In the preceding chapters, we discussed the features of general-purpose computer
architectures as well as some architectural specializations intended to address
domain-specific requirements. This chapter will focus on extensions commonly
implemented at the processor instruction set level to provide additional system
capabilities beyond generic computing needs.

After reading this chapter, you will understand the purpose of privileged processor modes
and how they operate in multiprocessing and multiuser contexts. You will be familiar
with the concepts of floating-point processors and instruction sets, techniques for power
management in battery-powered devices, and processor features intended to enhance
system security.

We will discuss the following processor extensions in this chapter:
* Privileged processor modes
* Floating-point mathematics
* Power management
* System security management
