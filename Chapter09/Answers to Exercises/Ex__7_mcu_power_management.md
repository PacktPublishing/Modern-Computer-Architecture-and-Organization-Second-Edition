What power management features do the i.MX RT1060 processors support?

# Answer
Section 12.4 of the reference manual describes the processor power management subsystem. Some of the key features are:
* Separate power domains for the processor, memory, and the remainder of the system.
* Integrated secondary power supplies that support independently powering a variety of subsystems.
* Voltage and clock frequency control enabling **dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)**.
* Temperature sensors.
* Voltage sensors.
