# Chapter 9, Exercise 6

Do the i.MX RT1060 processors support floating-point operations in hardware? Explain your answer.

# Answer
Section 1.3, **Features**, in the reference manual lists the following capability: **Single-precision and double-precision FPU (Floating Point Unit)**.

The **ARM Cortex-M7 Processor Technical Reference Manual**, available at http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0489b/DDI0489B_cortex_m7_trm.pdf states the FPU  **provides floating-point computation functionality that is compliant with the ANSI/IEEE Std 754-2008, IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, referred to as the IEEE 754 standard**.
