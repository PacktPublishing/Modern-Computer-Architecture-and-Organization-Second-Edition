# Modern Computer Architecture and Organization

This book presents the key technologies and components employed in modern processor
and computer architectures and discusses how various architectural decisions result in
computer configurations optimized for specific needs.

To understate the situation quite drastically, modern computers are complicated devices.
Yet, when viewed in a hierarchical manner, the functions of each level of complexity
become clear. We will cover a great many topics in these chapters and will only have
the space to explore each of them to a limited degree. My goal is to provide a coherent
introduction to each important technology and subsystem you might find in a modern
computing device and explain its relationship to other system components.

This book is intended for software developers, computer engineering students, system
designers, computer science professionals, reverse engineers, and anyone else seeking to
understand the architecture and design principles underlying all types of modern computer
systems from tiny embedded devices to smartphones to warehouse-sized cloud server farms.
Readers will also explore the directions these technologies are likely to take in the coming
years. A general understanding of computer processors is helpful but is not required.

This is the code repository for [Modern Computer Architecture and Organization ](https://www.packtpub.com/cloud-networking/modern-computer-architecture-and-organization?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838984397), published by Packt.

**Learn x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures and the design of smartphones, PCs, and cloud servers**

## What is this book about?
Are you a software developer, systems designer, or computer architecture student looking for a methodical introduction to digital device architectures but overwhelmed by their complexity? This book will help you to learn how modern computer systems work, from the lowest level of transistor switching to the macro view of collaborating multiprocessor servers. You'll gain unique insights into the internal behavior of processors that execute the code developed in high-level languages and enable you to design more efficient and scalable software systems.


This book covers the following exciting features:
Get to grips with transistor technology and digital circuit principles 
Discover the functional elements of computer processors 
Understand pipelining and superscalar execution 
Work with floating-point data formats 
Understand the purpose and operation of the supervisor mode 
Implement a complete RISC-V processor in a low-cost FPGA 
Explore the techniques used in virtual machine implementation 
Write a quantum computing program and run it on a quantum computer
