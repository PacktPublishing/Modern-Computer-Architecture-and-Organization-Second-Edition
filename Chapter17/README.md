# Chapter 14 - Future Directions in Computer Architectures

This chapter anticipates the road ahead for computer architecture design. We will review
the significant technological advances and ongoing trends that have led us to the current
state of computer architectures. We will then extrapolate from current trends and identify
some of the directions that computing system designs are likely to take in the future. We
will also examine some potentially disruptive technologies that may alter the evolution
of future computer architectures.

This chapter offers some suggested approaches for the professional development of the
computer architect. By following these recommendations, you should be able to maintain a
skill set that remains relevant and tolerant of future advances, whatever they turn out to be.

After completing this chapter, you will understand the historical evolution of computer
architecture that led to its current state and will be familiar with ongoing trends in computer
design that are likely to indicate future technological directions. You will have a basic level of
knowledge of some potentially disruptive technologies that might substantially alter future
computer architectures. You will also have learned some useful techniques for maintaining
an ongoing, current skill set in the field of computer architecture.

The following topics will be presented in this chapter:
* The ongoing evolution of computer architectures
* Extrapolating current trends into the future
* Potentially disruptive technologies
* Building a future-tolerant skill set
