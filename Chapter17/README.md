# Chapter 17 - Quantum Computing and other Future Directions in Computer Architectures

This chapter anticipates the road ahead for computer architecture design. We will review the significant technological advances and ongoing trends that have led to the current state of computer architectures. We will then extrapolate current trends and identify some directions that computing system designs are likely to take in the future. We will also examine some potentially disruptive technologies that may substantially alter the evolution of future computer architectures.

This chapter provides some suggested approaches for the professional development of the computer architect. By following these recommendations, you should be able to maintain a skill set that remains relevant and tolerant of future advances, whatever they turn out to be.

After completing this chapter, you will understand the historical evolution of computer architecture that led to its current state and will be familiar with ongoing trends in computer design and their likely impact on future technological directions. You will be aware of some potentially disruptive technologies that might significantly alter future computer architectures. You will also have learned some useful techniques for maintaining an ongoing, current skill set in the field of computer architecture.

The following topics will be presented in this chapter:

* The ongoing evolution of computer architectures
* Extrapolating current trends into the future
* Potentially disruptive technologies
* Building a future-tolerant skill set for the architectural professional
