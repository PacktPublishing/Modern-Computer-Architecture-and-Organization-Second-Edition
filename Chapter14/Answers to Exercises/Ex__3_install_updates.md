# Chapter 14, Exercise 3

Update the operating system and other applications and services (such as Java) on all computers and other devices under your control. This will ensure the security updates included in those updates start working to protect you soon after they become available. Set up a plan to continue regularly installing updates as they are released to ensure you are protected in the future.

# Answer
Go into the update settings for each device and see if any updates are awaiting installation. If they are, install them.

If no updates are waiting, have the device check for updates and install any that are available.

Start each application you use and rely on and have it check for updates. Install any that are available.

If an application has an option to automatically check for updates, ensure it is turned on. You may want to be notified when updates are available but not have them installed automatically.

Set up a repeating reminder in your calendar application to notify you to check for updates for all devices and applications at the shortest interval you believe is reasonable, whether it is weekly, biweekly, or monthly. Don't wait too long between updates because your systems are vulnerable during the period between the identification of the vulnerability and your installation of the update that fixes it.
