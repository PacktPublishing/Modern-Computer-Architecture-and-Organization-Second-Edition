# Chapter 14, Exercise 2

Create strong passwords for all your internet-accessible accounts containing information of value that cannot be protected by two-factor authentication. A strong password is long (15 characters or more) and includes uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters (for example: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) \* +). To keep track of these complicated passwords, install and use a reputable password safe application. Use care when selecting a password safe and consider its source.

# Answer
There are many options for securely storing passwords for use in your computer and in other devices. Most web browsers offer password management, as do most antivirus software packages. Standalone password manager applications are available as well. You can start to narrow your choices by performing an internet search for *password manager*.

When a site asks you to set a password, you can have the password manager generate a long random-looking string of characters as your new password. You won't need to remember the password because it will be stored securely by the password manager.

When selecting a password management solution, you should consider the need to maintain current passwords on all your devices. When you change the password for a site, you do not want to have to update to the new password in several places. A browser-based password manager such as [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org) will take care of this for you as long as you have a Firefox account and you have logged into it on each device.
