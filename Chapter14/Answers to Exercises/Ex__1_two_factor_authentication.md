# Chapter 14, Exercise 1

Where supported, set up two-factor authentication for all your internet-accessible accounts containing data that you care about. This includes bank accounts, email accounts, social media, code repositories (if you are a software developer), medical services, and anything else you value. Ensure at all stages that you are using only information and software applications from trusted sources.

# Answer
A comprehensive list of websites and their support (or non-support) for two-factor authentication is a available at ![2FA Directory](https://2fa.directory/). 2FA is an abbreviation of two-factor authentication.

The most common method for implementing two-factor authentication is for the site to send an SMS text containing a code to the phone number associated with the account after the user enters a valid username and password. The code is often a 6-digit number that the user must provide to the website to complete the login process. The two factors used for authentication are the user's knowledge of the account password and the demonstrated access to the phone associated with the account.

Some sites support an app such as the ![Duo Mobile App](https://duo.com/product/multi-factor-authentication-mfa/duo-mobile-app) for two-factor authentication. When accessing a site that uses the app, after entering username and password information, a notification will appear on your phone. With a single tap, you can approve access and finish logging in.
