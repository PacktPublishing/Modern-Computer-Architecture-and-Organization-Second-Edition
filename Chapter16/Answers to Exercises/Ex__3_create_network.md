# Chapter 16, Exercise 3

Create a program using the TensorFlow library that builds a CNN using the structure shown in Figure 16.2. Use a 3x3 convolution filter in each convolutional layer. Use 32 filters in the first convolutional layer and 64 filters in the other two convolutional layers. Use 64 neurons in the hidden layer. There are 10 output neurons representing an imageâ€™s presence in one of the 10 CIFAR-10 categories.

# Answer
This is the CNN structure of Figure 16.2:

![CNN structure](cnn-structure.png)

See the python file [Ex__3_create_network.py](src/Ex__3_create_network.py) for the code to create the CNN model.

To execute the program, assuming **python** is installed and is in your path, execute the command **python Ex__3_create_network.py**

**Note:** You can ignore any warning messages about not having a GPU present if your system doesn't have one. The code will execute on the system processor if a GPU is not configured for use with TensorFlow.

This is the output of a test run:
