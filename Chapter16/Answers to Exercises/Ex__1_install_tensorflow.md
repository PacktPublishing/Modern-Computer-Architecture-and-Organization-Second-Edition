# Chapter 16, Exercise 1

If you do not already have Python installed on your computer, visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install the current version. Ensure Python is in your search path by typing **python â€“version** at a system command prompt. You should receive a response similar to **Python 3.9.6**. Install TensorFlow (an open source platform for machine learning) with the command (also at the system command prompt) **pip install tensorflow**. Install Matplotlib (a library for visualizing data) with the command **pip install matplotlib**.

# Answer
See the Windows batch file [Ex__1_install_tensorflow.bat](src/Ex__1_install_tensorflow.bat) for the commands to install TensorFlow and Matplotlib.

To run the batch file, assuming **python** is installed and is in your path, execute the command **Ex__1_install_tensorflow.bat**
