# Chapter 13 - Domain-Specific Computer Architectures

This chapter brings together the topics discussed in previous chapters to develop an
approach for architecting a computer system designed to meet unique user requirements.
We will build upon this approach to gain an understanding of the user-level requirements
and performance capabilities associated with several different categories of real-world
computer systems.

This chapter will cover the following topics:
* Architecting computer systems to meet unique requirements
* Smartphone architecture
* Personal computer architecture
* Warehouse-scale computing architecture
* Neural networks and machine learning architectures
