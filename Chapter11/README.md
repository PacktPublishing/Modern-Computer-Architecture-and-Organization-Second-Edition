# Chapter 11 - The RISC-V Architecture and Instruction Set

This chapter introduces the exciting, relatively new RISC-V (pronounced *risk five*) processor
architecture and its instruction set. RISC-V is a completely open source specification for a
reduced instruction set processor. A complete user-mode (non-privileged) instruction set
specification has been released, and several inexpensive hardware implementations of this
architecture are currently available. Work is ongoing to develop specifications for a number
of instruction set extensions to support general-purpose computing, high-performance
computing, and embedded applications. Commercially available processors implement
many of these developmental extensions.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
* The RISC-V architecture and features
* The RISC-V base instruction set
* RISC-V extensions
* 64-bit RISC-V
* Standard RISC-V configurations
* RISC-V assembly language
* Implementing RISC-V in a **field-programmable gate array (FPGA)**

After completing this chapter, you will understand the architecture and capabilities of
the RISC-V processor and its optional extensions. You will have learned the basics of the
RISC-V instruction set and will understand how RISC-V can be tailored to support a
variety of computer architectures, from low-end embedded systems to warehouse-scale
cloud server farms. You will also have learned how to implement a RISC-V processor
in a low-cost FPGA board.
