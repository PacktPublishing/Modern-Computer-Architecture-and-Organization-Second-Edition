# Chapter 7, Exercise 1

A 16-bit embedded processor has separate memory regions for code and data. Code is stored in flash memory and modifiable data is stored in RAM. Some data values, such as constants and initial values for RAM data items, are stored in the same flash memory region as the program instructions. RAM and ROM reside in the same address space. Which of the processor architectures described in this chapter is most representative of this processor?

# Answer
Because the code and data are located in the same address space, this is a **von Neumann architecture**.

The fact that the code and some data items are stored in ROM and other data items reside in RAM is not relevant to determining the architecture category.
