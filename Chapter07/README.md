# Chapter 7 - Processor and Memory Architectures

This chapter takes a deeper look at modern processor architectures, specifically the von
Neumann, Harvard, and modified Harvard variants, and the computing domains in which
each architecture tends to be applied. The concepts and benefits of paged virtual memory,
used extensively in consumer and business computing and in portable smart devices,
are also introduced. We will examine the practical details of memory management in the
real-world context of Windows NT and later Windows versions. The chapter concludes
with a discussion of the features and functions of a memory management unit.

After completing this chapter, you will have learned the key features of modern processor
architectures and the use of physical and virtual memory. You will understand the benefits
of memory paging and the functions of the memory management unit.

This chapter covers the following topics:
* The von Neumann, Harvard, and modified Harvard architectures
* Physical and virtual memory
* Paged virtual memory
* The memory management unit
