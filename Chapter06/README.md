# Chapter 6 - Specialized Computing Domains

Most computer users are, at least superficially, familiar with key performance-related
attributes of personal computers and smart digital devices, such as processor speed and
**random-access memory (RAM)** size. This chapter explores the performance requirements
of computing domains that tend to be less directly visible to users, including real-time
systems, digital signal processing, and **graphics processing unit (GPU)** processing.

We will examine the unique computing features associated with each of these domains
and review some examples of modern devices implementing these concepts.

After completing this chapter, you will be able to identify application areas that require
real-time computing and you will understand the uses of digital signal processing, with an
emphasis on wireless communication. You will also understand the basic architecture of
modern GPUs and will be familiar with some modern implementations of components
in the computing domains discussed in this chapter.

Th is chapter covers the following topics:
* Real-time computing
* Digital signal processing
* GPU processing
* Examples of specialized architectures
