# Chapter 2 - Digital Logic

This chapter builds upon the introductory topics presented in *Chapter 1, Introducing Computer Architecture* and provides a firm understanding of the digital building blocks
used in the design of modern processors. We begin with a discussion of the properties
of electrical circuits, before introducing transistors and examining their use as switching
elements in logic gates. We then construct latches, flip-flops, and ring counters from
the basic logic gates. More complex components, including registers and adders, are
developed by combining the devices introduced earlier. The concept of sequential logic,
meaning logic that contains state information that varies over time, is developed. The
chapter ends with an introduction to hardware description languages, which are the
preferred design method for complex digital devices.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
* Electrical circuits
* The transistor
* Logic gates
* Latches
* Flip-flops
* Registers
* Adders
* Clocking
* Sequential logic
* Hardware description languages
