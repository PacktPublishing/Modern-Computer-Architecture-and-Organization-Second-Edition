# Chapter 5, Exercise 1
Restart your computer and enter the BIOS or UEFI settings. Examine each of the menus available in this environment. Does your computer have BIOS or does it use UEFI? Does your motherboard support overclocking? Note: When you are finished, be sure to select the option to quit without saving changes unless you are absolutely certain you want to make changes.

# Answer
In Windows, you can enter the BIOS/UEFI settings by changing the startup options while Windows is running. To access these settings, perform the following steps:
1. In the Windows Search box, type **startup** and select **Change advanced startup options**.
1. Select the **Restart now** button under **Advanced startup**.
1. When asked **Choose an option**, select **Troubleshoot**.
1. In the **Troubleshoot** screen, select **Advanced options**.
1. In the **Advanced options** screen, select **UEFI Firmware Settings**.
1. in the **UEFI Firmware Settings** screen, click the **Restart** button.
1. The system will restart and display the UEFI configuration main screen. Use the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to move between the screens.

To answer the questions for a specific computer system (an Asus ZenBook UX303LA laptop in this example):
* Although the messages displayed in the menus use the term "BIOS" freely, mentions of "EFI applications" and its age indicate it is actually **UEFI**.
* **No overclocking options** are available.

After finished examining the UEFI information, exit without saving changes by following these steps:
1. Move to the **Save & Exit** page.
1. Use the up and down arrow keys to select **Discard Changes and Exit**.
1. Press **Enter**.
1. Select **Yes** and press **Enter** on the **Exit Without Saving** dialog.
1. The system will reboot.
