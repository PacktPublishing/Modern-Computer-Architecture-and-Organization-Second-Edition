Visit the blockchain explorer at https://bitaps.com and locate the list of last blocks on that page. Click on a block number and you will be presented with a display containing the hexadecimal listing of the block header along with its SHA-256 hash. Copy both items and write a program to determine if the hash provided is the correct hash of the header. Remember to perform SHA-256 twice to compute the header hash.

A comprehensive list of websites and their support (or non-support) for two-factor authentication is available at [2FA Directory](https://2fa.directory/). 2FA is an abbreviation for two-factor authentication.

The most common method for implementing two-factor authentication is for the site to send an SMS text containing a code to the phone number associated with the account after the user enters a valid username and password. The code is often a 6-digit number that the user must provide to the website to complete the login process. The two factors used for authentication are the user's knowledge of the account password and the demonstrated access to the phone associated with the account.

Some sites support an app such as the [Duo Mobile App](https://duo.com/product/multi-factor-authentication-mfa/duo-mobile-app) for two-factor authentication. When accessing a site that uses the app, after entering username and password information, a notification will appear on your phone. With a single tap, you can approve access and finish logging in.
