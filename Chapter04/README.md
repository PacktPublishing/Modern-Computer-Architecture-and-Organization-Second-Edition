__Modern Computer Architecture and Organization__, by Jim Ledin. Published by Packt Publishing.
# Chapter 4 - Computer System Components

This chapter begins with an introduction to the **metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)**
transistor, used extensively in memory circuits and in most other modern digital devices.
We then examine the design of computer memory circuits based on MOS transistors and
their interface to the processor. We'll look at modern computer input/output interfaces,
with a focus on the use of high-speed serial communication within the computer's case,
as well as over cable connections to external peripherals. The functional requirements
of system I/O devices including the graphics display, network interface, keyboard, and
mouse will be discussed. The chapter ends with a descriptive example of the specifications
for a modern computer motherboard.

After completing this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the hardware
components of modern computer systems, from the technical specifications down to
the circuit level. You will have learned how system memory is implemented, including
the basics of caching. You will understand the mechanisms of efficient I/O operations,
and how USB is used to connect the keyboard, mouse, and other I/O devices. You will
understand the computer's network interface and will have become familiar with several
examples of modern computer system architectures.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
* Memory subsystem 
* Introducing the MOSFET
* Constructing DRAM circuits with MOSFETs 
* Input/output subsystems
* Graphics display interfaces
* Network interface
* Keyboard and mouse
* Modern computer system specifications
